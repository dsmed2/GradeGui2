# GradeGui2

# Brief
Shows each grade category and allows user to enter in grades and create results, the user then can, after calculating all the grades, continue to the home tab and calculate the overall grade for that said subject.

# Overview
Uses the Qt interface, UI,  to create a Gui so the user can easily determine grades without having to do it on a piece of paper. It uses basic c++ skills and Qt libraries to accomplish. When created a window will appear and preform the actions, like adding grades to specific tabs, Homework, Test, Projects, and etc. The other files needed will be provided for you with Qt.

# System Runs
Have used in Qt only and worked on windows and linux, in theory should still work on apple machines.

#How to run
Just open the GradeGui.pro in QT, configure, build, and run the project. It will guide you through how to configure it in QT. Once it is done building, a window will pop up with GUI.
